# fume-away

This is a printable soldering fume absorber / extractor. Not for the faint of heart! Some of the pieces take over 5 hours on a Prusa i3 MK2 and mostly fill up the bed (250 x 210 x 200 mm).

***Print requiring support***: `filter - cover.stl` (the slot for the cartridge has an overhang when printed face down).

That said, 0.2mm layer height, a decent amount of filament.
